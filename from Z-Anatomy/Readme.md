# Z-Anatomy
This repository contains the Blender template of the Z-Anatomy Project.  
It includes models derived from 'BodyParts3D' and definitions that heavily rely on Wikipedia.  
It was made by Gauthier Kervyn (design, 3D, anatomy) and Marcin Zielinski (Python script).  
This version is meant to be used as a navigable atlas within Blender.
It is a template and requires the following installation to work properly.
